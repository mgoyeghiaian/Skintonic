Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that uses a device to exfoliate and remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, younger-looking skin underneath. It can improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, and uneven skin texture, leaving the skin refreshed and rejuvenated.
