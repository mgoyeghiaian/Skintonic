A chemical peel is a skincare treatment where a chemical solution is applied to the skin, causing it to exfoliate and eventually peel off. This process removes damaged outer layers of skin, revealing smoother, clearer, and more youthful-looking skin underneath. Chemical peels can improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, acne scars, and hyperpigmentation, and promote overall skin rejuvenation.
