Laser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure that uses concentrated beams of light to target and destroy hair follicles, inhibiting future hair growth. It is a safe and effective method for long-term reduction or removal of unwanted hair from various parts of the body, providing smoother skin without the need for constant shaving or waxing.
