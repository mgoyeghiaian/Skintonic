A skin care treatment involves the application of products or procedures to improve the health and appearance of the skin. These treatments can range from basic cleansing and moisturizing routines to more advanced procedures like facials, chemical peels, or microdermabrasion, tailored to address specific skin concerns such as acne, aging, or uneven texture.
